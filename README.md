# BCV Rate scraper

This README is also available in [Spanish/Espa√±ol](README.es.md).

This project is a set of scripts to scrape currency values from the Banco Central de Venezuela (BCV) website.

The scripts are:

- `web_scrap.py`: This script scrapes the USD and EUR values from the BCV website and saves them to a file. It also logs the scraping operations to a log file and shows a desktop notification when the values are successfully scraped.

- `excel_scrap.py`: This script scrapes USD and EUR values from the xls files in the BCV website and saves them to a file. It also renames the files in the directory.

## Installation

### Installation Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Packages

- `beautifulsoup4`
- `xlrd`

## Configuration

To configure the scripts with different settings, edit the `config.py` file, the default values are:

```python
BCV_URL = "https://www.bcv.org.ve/"
OUTPUT_DIR = "./output/"
XLS_DIR = "./xls_files/"
XLS_FILE = OUTPUT_DIR + "excel.txt"
LOG_FILE = OUTPUT_DIR + "log.txt"
HISTORY_FILE = OUTPUT_DIR + "history.txt"
NOTIFICATION_ENABLED = True
RENAME_FILES_ENABLED = True
```

Note: currently notifications of new currency values found with `web_scrap.py` are done with notify-send, you can use any other notification CLI by modifying the `show_notification` function in the script.

## Usage

### Standalone use

To run the scripts standalone from the root directory, use the following commands:

```bash
python python -m bcv_scraper.web_scrap
```

```bash
python python -m bcv_scraper.excel_scrap
```

**Note:** the `web_scrap.py` can have an optional argument to run the script, which will add a value to the log file, this can be used to differentiate between runs from different contexts. for example :

```bash
python -m bcv_scraper.web_scrap auto
```

Will generate this entry in the log:

```text
2024-07-03 15:30:00 auto
```

### Running with cron

To run the scripts with cron, using the provided `script.sh` bash script, you can add the following lines to your crontab file

```text
*/30 15-16 * * 1-5 /absolute/path/to/project/script.sh
```

**Note:** You have to change this line on the bash script with the absolute path to the project.

```bash
fullpath="/absolute/path/to/project"
```
